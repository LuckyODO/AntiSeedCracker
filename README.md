# AntiSeedCracker

A Spigot plugin making an effort to work against seed cracking mods.

## Requirements
- ProtocolLib 5.1+
- Spigot (and forks) 1.20.4

## Features
- Randomization of hashed seed on login/respawn/world change
- Modification of end spikes

## Help wanted/Features planned

- Biome name randomization (RealisticSeasons does this, but it's a lot of effort)
- Modification of more structures, we should be able to get locations through the seed which we have access to.

## Build

gradle build
```
